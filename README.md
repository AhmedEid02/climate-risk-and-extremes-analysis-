Reproducible climate and geospatial analyses of climate variability, extremes, and risk-informed assessment using reanalysis, satellite data, and CMIP6 projections.
# Climate Risk and Extremes Analysis

This repository contains a collection of reproducible climate and geospatial analyses focused on **climate variability, extremes, and risk-informed assessment** in data-scarce regions, with a primary focus on Somaliland and the Horn of Africa.

The work reflects independent research analyses conducted using **reanalysis data, satellite observations, and climate model projections**, and aligns with applications in **early warning systems, climate risk assessment, and resilience research**.
